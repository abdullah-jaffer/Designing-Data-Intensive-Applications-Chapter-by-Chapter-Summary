# Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Chapter-by-Chapter-Summary

I'll be summarizing my readings from Martin Kleppmann's book [Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) in this repo chapter by chapter in my own pace.

This might help people who do not have the time to read the 600+ page book or just wants to revise some lessons from the chapters.
Anyone is welcome to proofread, suggest revisons and/or other changes.
