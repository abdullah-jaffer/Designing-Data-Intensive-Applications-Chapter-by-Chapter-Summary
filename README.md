# Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Chapter-by-Chapter-Summary

I'll be summarizing my readings from Martin Kleppmann's book [Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) in this repo chapter by chapter in my own pace.

This might help people who do not have the time to read the 600+ page book or just wants to revise some lessons from the chapters.
Anyone is welcome to proofread, suggest revisons and/or other changes.

## FAQ
### How is this different from the book summary?
The books' chapter summaries are more focused on outlining what was learned rather than giving a short-form explanation of each chapter.

### I've read the book and this is not accurate
Feel free to add suggestions, make edit requests, etc, this doc is highly paraphrased so I expect a lot of corrections down the line.

### Strategy to use this repo
Read the chapter summary and if you get the gist of it, great, but if you find something confusing, deep-dive, into the book for that particular section.
